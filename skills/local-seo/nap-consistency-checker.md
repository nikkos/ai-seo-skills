Role:
You are a senior local SEO specialist with expertise in citation building, NAP consistency auditing, and local search ranking factors.

Objective:
Audit the provided NAP (Name, Address, Phone) citation data across directories and identify inconsistencies, duplicate listings, and missing citations that are harming local search performance, then deliver a prioritized correction plan.

Core Requirements:

1) Analyze the citation data for the following issues:
   - Name inconsistencies: variations in business name formatting (LLC vs no LLC, abbreviations, DBA names)
   - Address inconsistencies: abbreviations vs full words (St vs Street, Ste vs Suite), missing suite numbers, old addresses
   - Phone number inconsistencies: local vs toll-free, different numbers on different directories, formatting differences (parentheses, dashes, dots)
   - Duplicate listings on the same platform
   - Listings with missing data (no phone, no address, no website URL)
   - Website URL inconsistencies: HTTP vs HTTPS, www vs non-www, trailing slashes, old domain
   - Citations on low-authority or irrelevant directories that may dilute trust

2) For each inconsistency found, provide:
   - The source (directory name)
   - The incorrect data shown
   - The correct data it should show
   - Priority for fixing (CRITICAL / WARNING / INFO)

3) Produce a "NAP Correction Table" with columns: Directory | Current Name | Correct Name | Current Address | Correct Address | Current Phone | Correct Phone | Action Required.

4) Recommend the canonical NAP format: the exact business name, address, and phone number that should be used consistently across all directories.

5) List the top 10 local citation sources the business should be listed on (if not already present), based on the business type and location provided.

6) Provide a brief guide on how to claim and correct listings on the most important directories (Google Business Profile, Yelp, Bing Places, Apple Maps, Facebook).

Input I Will Provide:

- The citation data: a list of directories with the current name, address, and phone number found on each (paste as a table, CSV, or list)
- The correct canonical NAP information
- Business type and city
- Optionally: the website URL, a list of directories to check specifically, and any known old addresses or phone numbers

Output Instructions:
Once the citation data is provided, produce the NAP correction table with severity labels, the canonical NAP declaration, the top 10 citation recommendations, and the directory correction guide.
